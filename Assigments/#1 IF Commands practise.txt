You are given the temperature and a keyword in a greenhouse. There is only a certain range of temperatures that are allowed. If outside the range, you must print a warning. The keyword you will receive will either be- “Fahrenheit” or “Celsius”. The temperature will be a number. The range of temperatures in Celsius is 20 to 35. The range of Fahrenheit is 68 to 95. 
For example – if the keyword is Celsius is the temperature is 15, then you must print a warning. But if the keyword is Fahrenheit and the temperature is 70, then you don’t have to print a warning. 

Make 2 variables – temperature and keyword. Make your code so that it uses the variables to solve the problem above. To test the scenarios below, change the values of the variables accordingly. 

Run the scenarios below – 
#Scenario 1: Temperature = 25, keyword = “Fahrenheit”
#Scenario 2: Temperature = 25, keyword = “Celsius”
#Scenario 3: Temperature = 40, keyword = “Celsius”

Note – Use multiple logical operators instead of “==”. For example, you can use “>” for a greater than operator. Or use “<” for less than operator. The code below uses different kinds of operators – 
#This code checks whether the variable temperature is less than 20.
If (temperature < 20):
	Print(warning)
